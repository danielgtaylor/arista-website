Arista Website
==============
This project tracks development on the Arista Transcoder website, located here:

Getting Started
---------------
Making changes to the site is easy once you get it set up:

    git clone git://github.com/danielgtaylor/arista-website.git
    cd arista-website
    ./init.sh
    ./manage.py runserver

Now go to http://localhost:8000/ and start playing around :-)
