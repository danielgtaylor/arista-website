  * setup.py: Fail gracefully if byte-compiling doesn't work on install

  * arista-gtk: Remove debug print statement

  locale/zh_TW/LC_MESSAGES/arista.mo: Update translations from Launchpad

2011-06-19  Daniel G. Taylor <dan@programmer-art.org>

  * arista-gtk: Fix output file naming when input path isn't the same as the
  output directory, also fixes naming and overwriting of inputs from dvd and
  v4l sources.

  * arista-gtk: Reorganize preset selection code based on mouse coordinates on
  the logo widget, change drag and drop to only work on the logo widget and
  preview widget and make it sensitive to the location that was dropped on,
  defaulting to WebM if no preset icon was dropped on.

2011-06-18  Daniel G. Taylor <dan@programmer-art.org>

  * README.md: Add link to translations pages on Launchpad so they are easier
  to find

  * arista-gtk: Modify logo widget to listen to button click events, have the
  main window listen for clicks and when one of the icons in the logo is
  clicked open the create conversion dialog with the corresponding preset
  selected. This should serve as a nice shortcut and help remove new user
  confusion as they may expect something to happen when clicking the icons in
  logo. Thanks to Primoz Verdnik for the user experience help.

2011-06-17  Daniel G. Taylor <dan@programmer-art.org>

  * arista/queue.py: Make sure to remove failed items from the queue after they
  error out, and set the pipe to not running so that the next item will start
  processing. Thanks to Bram Avontuur for pointing out this issue to me.

  * ui/main.ui: Change cancel button on main dialog to be the media stop button
  instead, as really we are stopping a job. The data transcoded so far will
  still work, and nothing is undone as cancel may imply. This also makes more
  sense when talking about live input sources that have no end. You aren't
  canceling them so much as stopping the conversion.

  * arista-gtk: Small cleanup - emove some old code that is no longer used

  * arista-gtk: Disable create button when no DVD is actually inserted,
  prevents accidentally starting DVD jobs and having them error out right away

  * arista/transcoder.py: Add tolerance value to audiorate element by default.
  This fixes some audio glitch issues, in particular from WMV input files.
  Fixes issue #12

  * presets/apple.json: Update Apple iOS presets to ease up on reference frames
  and set the x264 profile, which should limit the use of bframes and fix #79
  for GStreamer 0.10.32

2011-06-16  Daniel G. Taylor <dan@programmer-art.org>

  * arista-gtk: Implement basic drag and drop of single files and directories
  onto the main window. Multiple files currently does not work and requires
  larger changes.

  * arista-gtk: Fix icon size being used to lookup icons - makes file type
  icons and some other icons like the dvd disc show up properly in the source
  selector

  * arista-gtk: GTK GUI now runs reniced to +5 by default, which should allow
  other programs to take priority while transcodes are going on, making the
  system feel overall snappier on many different schedulers. Fixes issue #23.

  * arista-gtk: Handle bad values for icon in case of e.g. messed up tar file
  or user-modified json with errors

  * arista-gtk: Fix issue #7 - problem importing preset with apparently invalid
  value for icon

  * presets/playstation.json: Update PSP preset to force 30 frames per second,
  which is apparently required for some PSP versions according to issue #49

  * arista-gtk, help/ac-3.html, help/mp2.html, presets/dvd.json: Add MP2 and
  AC-3 audio formats, update DVD preset to use MP2 instead of MP3 as the audio
  format as this is what it should have used all along, whoops. Thanks to
  guiodic for the bug report.

2011-06-15  Daniel G. Taylor <dan@programmer-art.org>

  * help/style.css: Update help file style by adding slight rounded corners and
  text shadows

  * MANIFEST.in: Make sure to include CSS for help files when creating
  distributable archives for installation

  * locale/templates/arista.pot: Update translation template to include new
  preset reset functionality

  * utils/update_translation.sh: Fix small bug in translation update script

  * arista-gtk, arista-transcode, arista/presets.py, ui/prefs.ui: Add a method
  to completely reset default presets, add button to do so from GTK prefs
  dialog and an argument to do so via arista-transcode

  * arista/presets.py: Use set to find images when exporting a device preset so
  that a file doesn't get added to the archive multiple times, which causes
  issues when importing

  * arista-gtk: Fix issue where single file conversions wouldn't use the
  destination folder that was selected

  * arista-gtk: Add VP8 codec support for AVI container

  * arista-gtk, help/flac.html: Add FLAC audio codec support to UI

  * arista-gtk: Rename MPEG2 PS and TS to just MPEG PS and TS, which is more
  consistent with how other apps name them

  * ui/props.ui: Fix translation bug, patch by Bastien Nocera

  * ui/logo.svg: Update logo to include iPad and Android phone, removing older
  iPod and phone images

  * ui/prefs.ui: Cleanup preferences dialog spacing and default width/height

  * arista/discoverer.py: Check for and gracefully handle index errors while
  trying to find usable capabilities objects in discoverer

  * arista/discoverer.py: Update discoverer to not assume all required
  information will be in the first caps element. It seems for some files it may
  come later, so iterate over caps until we find what we need to get the
  width/height/etc of media files

2011-06-14  Daniel G. Taylor <dan@programmer-art.org>

  * presets/android-galaxy-s.png, presets/ipod-video.svg, presets/web.svg,
  ui/icon-badge.svg, ui/icon-small.svg, ui/icon.svg: Optimize logo, application
  icon, and several larger preset icons to drastically lower file size of the

  the xgettext -j option to join PO template files properly

  * locale/templates/arista.pot: Update translation template

  presets page online so they can download new presets easily as this function
  was taken out by the new add dialog

  * presets/computer.json, presets/web.json: Update computer and web presets to
  show how preset-level descriptions work

  * arista-transcode: Add preset descriptions to arista-transcode info output

  * README.md: Add instructions for trying out the latest version from git

  * presets/android.json: Update Android presets by adding profile constraints
  which seem to prevent choppy playback and errors according to many users

  * arista/transcoder.py: Apply pixel aspect ratio to original width instead of
  after width calculations are completed. This prevents issues where the PAR
  would modify the width to an invalid value after calculation. Patch by
  kogechanotaremimiusagi

2011-06-13  Daniel G. Taylor <dan@programmer-art.org>

  * arista-transcode: Don't require the entire preset name, just the first few
  characters to make fetching preset info easier

  * locale/templates/arista.pot: Update translation template with new strings

  to fix a bug where part of the common options documentation was hidden from
  view

  * ui/codec.ui: Add border around web view for codec help dialog

2011-06-12  Daniel G. Taylor <dan@programmer-art.org>

  * ui/prefs.ui: Update default size of preferences window to be slightly
  smaller due to the removal of some preferences

  * ui/add.ui: Change the type hint of the add window so that it doesn't try to
  stay on top of other windows, which was causing problems with the e.g. input
  properties dialog

  * arista-gtk: Fix typo causing error messages when changing audio codec

  * arista-gtk: Fix FLV supported codecs to match the proper strings

  * arista-gtk: Don't modify the last used folder when selecting icons for
  presets, and instead of preloading the last used path [which usually will be
  for videos] just set the default path to the user's pictures folder which is
  more likely to contain icons

  * arista-gtk, ui/preset.ui: Add extension to preset dialog so that it can be
  edited, which might be useful when doing e.g. MOV but naming the files m4v

  * arista-gtk: Remove large chunk of code that is no longer used

  * arista/presets.py: Make sure to reset the current working directory after
  export

  before /usr

2011-06-10  Daniel G. Taylor <dan@programmer-art.org>

  options are first

  * arista-gtk, ui/preset.ui: Make sure to store changes to the audio and video
  options, whoops

  * arista/presets.py: Fix bug causing element linking to fail after having
  modified a preset due to not enforcing types properly on load. Also fixes a
  small bug to only write out fractions when really needed.

  * arista-transcode: Fix indentation error preventing arista-transcode from
  working properly

  * arista-gtk, arista-transcode, arista/presets.py, ui/prefs.ui: Remove the
  ability to check for updates as this hasn't really been useful in the time it
  has been available.

  * README.md: Remove section in README on creating new device presets as this
  is now handled in-app

  * MANIFEST.in, setup.py: Make sure help files get installed

  * arista-gtk: Update new preset default vcoded pass to match default computer
  H.264 preset

  * arista-gtk, ui/preset.ui: Make sure to update list view when icon changes,
  created new preset dialog signal to handle this case

  * arista-gtk: Implement adding new device presets in-app, small refactoring
  and cleanup

  preset changed signal so that when filtering or sorting the list view we
  don't lose the ability to modify the preset iter in the list

  * arista-gtk: Set automatic sorting on add dialog presets list model

  * arista-gtk: Update create dialog view as presets are modified in the preset
  info and edit dialogs

  preset icons and changing preset shortnames in a hopefully not-to-confusing
  way

2011-06-09  Daniel G. Taylor <dan@programmer-art.org>

  * arista/utils.py: Make sure directory for writeable paths is present before
  returning the path

  * arista/utils.py: Add utility method to get a writeable path for creating
  new files using the default search path mechanism used to also load files

2011-06-08  Daniel G. Taylor <dan@programmer-art.org>

  * arista-gtk, ui/preset.ui: Update the way handling of preset name changes
  works to be more efficient, add dummy handlers for icon and shortname change

  * help/flv.html, help/mpeg2.html: Codec documentation fixes

  * README.md, arista-gtk, help/404.html, help/aac.html, help/common.html,
  help/flv.html, help/h.264.html, help/mp3.html, help/mpeg2.html,

  This just adds a --crop/-c parameter, taking 4 space separeted integers. The
  values represent: top, right, bottom, left - in that order. The values are
  requierd to be positive and this is checked for. 

  * arista/transcoder.py: Initial implenentation of cropping in transcoder.py 
  This adds a new crop option to TranscoderOptions. crop is expected to be a
  tuple of 4 ints, but could maybe be changed to allow other values such as
  "auto" 

2011-01-24  Daniel G. Taylor <dan@programmer-art.org>

  * README.md, arista-gtk, arista/__init__.py, presets/android.json,

  presets/ps3.json, presets/psp.json, setup.py, ui/about.ui, ui/add.ui,
  ui/main.ui: Major UI update: simplify main dialog, create separate dialog for
  adding conversion jobs, remove the queue display as it was hardly used and
  instead put the number of files left in the progress bar, move the pause
  button from the main toolbar to the same place as the cancel button which
  only shows when a job is running.

2011-01-10  Vladimir Ugrumov <alkesta007@yandex.ru>

  * presets/psp.json: Fix issue #49 (H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Main Profile Level 3 Sony

  open Arista for DVDs and VCDs when inserted, patch by karlrelton, fixes issue
  #40

  * arista-gtk: Show simplified GTK interface centered so that conversions from
  nautilus don't show up in random locations on the screen

  * presets/android-spica.png, presets/android.json: Add Samsung Spica in
  Android preset file

2010-07-08  danielgtaylor <dan@programmer-art.org>

  * arista/transcoder.py: Start scanning DVD titles from zero instead of 1,
  dagb found and notified me of via IRC - thanks

2010-06-29  danielgtaylor <dan@programmer-art.org>

  * arista/transcoder.py: Allow videos to be upscaled to fit as closely as
  possible to the requested box size of a preset. This allows small videos to
  be upscaled but still adds padding where necessary [e.g. to the width] to
  achieve the required dimensions.

2010-06-23  danielgtaylor <dan@programmer-art.org>

  * arista/transcoder.py: Update videobox usage to add ffmpegcolorspace to fix
  potential link problems to encoders like xvidenc. Added a note to remove this
  hack when it is no longer needed.

2010-06-20  danielgtaylor <dan@programmer-art.org>

2010-06-18  danielgtaylor <dan@programmer-art.org>

  * setup.py: Fix issue #14 - arista-nautilus should be byte compiled at
  install time. Also removes a warning when distutils doesn't likethe zip_safe
  option required for easy_install to work.

2010-06-17  danielgtaylor <dan@programmer-art.org>

  * arista-gtk, arista-transcode: Fix Issue #15 - Python shebang lines should
  read /usr/bin/python

  * arista/presets.py, arista/transcoder.py: Allow presets to specify custom
  elements to apply transformations to the video stream. This allows you to
  rotate, for example, by setting "transform": "videoflip method=clockwise" in
  the JSON device preset. Since any element can be used and you are modifying
  raw video this can also be used to add effects, color balance, sharpen, etc.

2010-06-13  danielgtaylor <dan@programmer-art.org>

  * README.md: Add note about Debian dependencies as mentioned in issue #13

2010-06-12  danielgtaylor <dan@programmer-art.org>

2010-06-10  danielgtaylor <dan@programmer-art.org>

  * README.md: Fix small typo in example GStreamer pipeline

  * README.md: Updated dependencies to show that both udev and dbus+HAL are
  supported, added minimum python version info to deps

  * locale/templates/arista.pot: Updated translations to include new nautilus
  extension

  * utils/update_translation.sh: Update script to update translation template
  file to also include new nautilus script

  * utils/run_tests.py: Update test runner syntax to the new arista-transcode
  syntax and always output a status report even if the user stops the tests
  early.

  * arista/discoverer.py, arista/transcoder.py: Implement DVD main feature
  title auto-discovery by checking all titles and picking the one with the
  longest duration if no explicit title is given. You can still rip explicit
  titles using arista-transcode or the simple GTK+ GUI with e.g.
  dvd:///dev/dvd@2.

2010-06-09  danielgtaylor <dan@programmer-art.org>

  * arista-nautilus.py: Prevent Nautilus from locking up when running the
  simplified Arista GTK+ GUI during jobs

  * setup.py: Version bump to 0.9.5

  * arista-nautilus.py: Use the new simplified GTK+ GUI for the Nautilus
  extension

  * arista-gtk: Implement simplified GUI for scripts and the nautilus extension
  to use. This adds a --simple option to the GTK+ GUI that hides everything but
  the preview/progress area, takes in an optional device and preset and any
  number of filenames, and closes when the queue is empty.

  * ui/error.svg: Add error icon for failure message notifications

  * arista-gtk: Properly react to and show errors in the pipeline when they
  occur in the GTK+ GUI, including removing the items from the queue and
  processing others.

  * presets/computer.json: Updated H.264 computer preset to not use bframes as
  they can cause random crashes, fixes the x264_encoder_frame_end: Assertion
  'pic_out->i_pts >= pic_out->i_dts' failed issue.

  * arista/queue.py: Prevent crash when stopping items in the queue because
  there isn't always a source element anymore. Just pass an EOS signal to the
  entire pipe instead.

  * arista/transcoder.py: Switch back to dvdreadsrc so that title selection for
  DVDs works and to prevent endless loops and menus from being used in the
  output. This should go back to rsndvdbin through uridecodebin at some point
  but just isn't currenly possible.

  * arista/discoverer.py: Don't give up printing metadata if no mimetype could
  be found - it's possible stream data was still found

2010-06-07  danielgtaylor <dan@programmer-art.org>

  * screenshots/arista-clearlooks.png, screenshots/arista-futurama.png,
  screenshots/arista-human.png, screenshots/arista-shiki.png: Removed
  screenshots directory as they now reside in the arista-website project

  * arista-gtk: Update default preview framerate to be higher so users get more
  immediate and up-to-date feedback while transcoding

  * arista/transcoder.py: Catch NotImplementedError when getting the number of
  CPU cores, change default to 2 since most people seem to have dual-core
  systems now.

2010-06-06  danielgtaylor <dan@programmer-art.org>

  * arista/transcoder.py: For muxers that support audio and video pad
  templates, set them to prevent gst launch parsing issues with elements unable
  to link. Fixes an issue with my Toshiba M500's webcam when using
  x264enc/qtmux and mpeg2enc/ffmux_dvd. This prevents setting the pad template
  name for oggmux which was causing an issue previously as the pad names had
  been hard-coded for all muxers before

  * arista/queue.py: Fix potential crash when pipe creation has failed but you
  still try to remove an item from the queue

  * arista/discoverer.py: Only connect to unknown-type signal if the decoder
  bin actually supports it, prevents issue on DVD stream discovery

  * README.md, arista/__init__.py, ui/about.ui: Version bump to 0.9.5

  * arista/utils.py: Fix automagic naming of output files for DVD and V4L/V4L2
  source inputs to not use the absolute uri but instead use the path's
  basename. This prevents trying to write to /dev and such

  * arista/transcoder.py: Use uridecodebin when building the transcoding
  pipeline, similar to the latest change to the discoverer. This should
  simplify V4L and DVD source handling. On my Macbook this fixes recording from
  webcams.

  * arista/discoverer.py: Update discoverer to use uridecodebin as it
  simplifies dealing with webcams, video cameras, DVD media, etc. DVD title
  selection is now totally automatic and uses the same logic as e.g. Totem.

  * arista-gtk: Update GTK GUI to use the modified queue signal for discovered
  entries

  * arista/queue.py: Add entry-pass-setup and entry-error signals to queue,

  arista python library utilities

2010-06-04  danielgtaylor <dan@programmer-art.org>

  * arista-nautilus.py: Added Nautilus extension to allow converting media

2010-06-03  danielgtaylor <dan@programmer-art.org>

  * setup.py: Don't install translation README, do install README, LICENSE, and
  AUTHORS files to the doc directory as this seems to be the proper thing to
  do.

  * arista-gtk: Fix adding disk and video input sources to the queue as they
  are not normal files, instead check if the selected file is a directory and
  if so, treat it as such, but if not then treat it as a normal file

  * README.md: Add python-rsvg dependency when using KDE as reported by Kubuntu
  user

2010-06-02  danielgtaylor <dan@programmer-art.org>

2010-06-01  danielgtaylor <dan@programmer-art.org>

  * locale/templates/arista.pot: Update translation template to reflect new
  strings and translation changes due to splitting of arista.inputs into its
  own module with fallback support for HAL

  * utils/update_translation.sh: Update translation template generation script

  * arista/inputs.py, arista/inputs/__init__.py, arista/inputs/haldisco.py,
  arista/inputs/udevdisco.py: Reimplement DBus+HAL device discovery as a
  fallback for people without udev, which happens to be a lot more than I ever
  expected. Sorry...

2010-05-30  danielgtaylor <dan@programmer-art.org>

  * README.md, arista/__init__.py, setup.py, ui/about.ui: Minor version bump to
  fix severe bug in 0.9.4 release

  * presets/computer-live.svg, presets/computer-webm.svg,
  presets/computer.json: Fix theora encoding, add icons to live and webm
  presets

  * arista-gtk: Fix an issue where the UI would freeze when not creating a new
  folder to output a directory of jobs to. Instead, just let users pick an
  existing folder as this is more intuitive.

  * debian/changelog, debian/compat, debian/control, debian/copyright,
  debian/rules: Remove debian files at the request of the Debian/Ubuntu
  downstream package maintainer.

  * arista-gtk: Implement processing entire directories. The source combo now
  contains a new item for choosing a directory to process. When adding to the
  queue, you choose a second directory and the default filenames for each entry
  given the input options and preset are generated as the output file. Each
  entry is added to the queue in one go, and then processed.

  * presets/web-webm.svg, presets/web.json: Add WebM icon based on
  webm-project.org site favicon using the Tango colors, set default web preset
  to be WebM

  * presets/computer.json, presets/web.json: Fix WebM presets by making sure to
  allow an audio bit width of 32 which the vorbis encoder needs.

  * arista/transcoder.py: Change audio processing pipeline to make caps use
  ranges to leave a little more leeway for pipeline element autonegotiation.
  Logic changes fix channel counts for vorbis encoder, among other small issues

  * arista/transcoder.py: Add support for dynamically setting variables in
  preset files, starting with a 'threads' variable that will be set by Arista
  based on the available CPU count found with the multiprocessing module.

  * presets/computer.json: Update computer preset to simplify options a bit and
  add WebM support; the computer presets are now *H.264, Live Input, Theora,
  and WebM with Live Input still requiring x264enc.

  * presets/computer.json, presets/ipad.json, presets/ps3.json,
  presets/psp.json: Update various presets to use qtmux instead of ffmux_mp4,
  minor version bumps

  * presets/android.json: Add HTC Desire name to Nexus One preset, update to
  use qtmux, version bump

  * README.md: Updated to make links show properly on Github

  property of devices which will ignore the 'Generic' make and instead just use
  the model as it should have before.

  * presets/flv.png, presets/web-flv.png, presets/web.json: Update web device
  presets to include H.264 and WebM, the latter will only work if you are
  running GStreamer trunk for now.

  * presets/ipod-iphone.svg, presets/ipod-touch.svg, presets/ipod-video.svg,
  presets/ipod.json, presets/ipod.svg: Updated Apple iPhone / iPod presets to
  specifically list different versions in the presets, adding to the changes
  from fcsonline

2010-05-28  danielgtaylor <dan@programmer-art.org>

  * presets/nokia-nseries.json: Update to add N900 support and default to the
  N900 instead of the N770

  * arista/transcoder.py: Remove hardcoded muxer sink names as they don't
  appear to be required these days - all my test files work without them and it
  allows us to use more muxers like flvmux. Fixes issue fcsonline was having.

  * arista-transcode: Fix printed statement that didn't adhere to the
  quiet/verbose arguments

  * utils/generate_tests.py, utils/run_tests.py: Fix the test generation and
  running scripts to work again, they were horribly out of date. Not all tests
  seem to pass on my local machine but it's a good start to improving any
  issues.

  * arista/transcoder.py: Add a method by which the transcoder can force a job
  to finish if it stalls for more than five seconds after starting. Even on
  really slow machines this should never happen, and it prevents issues where
  the application can freeze indefinitely for apparently no reason.

  * arista-transcode: Connect to and properly handle transcoder pipeline errors
  in terminal script to exit properly when needed

  * arista/transcoder.py: Add error signal for transcoder to be sent when e.g.
  a pipeline cannot be constructed properly so that applications can properly
  handle this situation

  * arista-gtk: Default to source directory when adding to queue and make sure
  to store the last used path when installing presets, just like when selecting
  a new source file

2010-05-27  danielgtaylor <dan@programmer-art.org>

  * arista-gtk, arista/presets.py: Device preset update methods now return a
  list of devices that were updated or installed; use this info to display
  notifications to the user when such actions happen; remove extra
  click-through dialog after installing updated presets and no longer destroy
  and restart main window after updates

2010-05-27  Ferran Basora <fcsonline@gmail.com>

  presets/android-nexus-one.svg, presets/android.json, presets/android.svg: Add
  single preset for Android: Nexus One, Motorola Droid, and G1

  * presets/d2.json, presets/d2.svg, presets/droid.json, presets/droid.svg,
  presets/nwz-818.json, presets/nwz-818.svg, presets/pda.json, presets/pda.png,
  presets/zen.json, presets/zen.svg: Cleanup default presets - to get these you
  need to now use the 'Download more' menu item and grab them from the website.
  This is to ensure a clean default setup without the menu growing to gigantic
  proportions, and each user on a computer can then store presets for only the
  devices they care about

  * arista-gtk: Don't crash when a specified icon file is missing

  * arista-gtk: Add link to create a new device preset, generalize the
  processing for menu items that are links

  * MANIFEST.in: Updated manifest to include the new JSON preset files when
  building distributions

2010-05-26  danielgtaylor <dan@programmer-art.org>

  new device presets as this will now be done manually, instead just download
  any available updates

  * arista-gtk, arista/queue.py: Only show notifications for entries that
  finish on their own - if we remove an item from the queue it should not show
  that it has finished.

2010-05-24  danielgtaylor <dan@programmer-art.org>

  * arista-gtk, arista/presets.py: Add ability to have an icon for each preset

  instead fall back to saying an unknown amount of time remains with no current
  status.

  how easy_install is allowed to handle the package and updating the search
  paths to include searching inside an unzipped egg within the virtual
  environment. Fixes lp bug 427688.

  multiple files from a single directory has become much more convenient. Fixes
  lp bug 407146.

  * presets/dvd.xml: Constrain DVD MPEG2 sizes as GStreamer DVD stuff doesn't
